AM Home Improvements Services

This project is under development and will be used by AMHIS - Avtar Minhas Home Improvements Services.

VERSION 1.0 i.e. the first release of the system would be a plain website with no website interaction with the database.
This version only aims to release the website and make it available to the public ASAP so that they could search it on search engines
, visit the website and in turn contact the Business Owners.
The version consists of a few images downloaded from pexels.com that have been used on the home page and a relative icon with the
website title. There is also an image used for overlay in the images that gives feel of dots on the image.
We have also included a few libraries that would help to fade in and locate the scroll position.
The release date of VERSION 1.0 is not yet finalized.
